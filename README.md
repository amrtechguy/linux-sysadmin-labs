# linux System Administration Labs
I'm sharing here my solutions to Linux System Administration scenarios.
I'm not an expert, I'm learning, practicing, and preparing for a Linux System Administration job.
All my solutions to the labs in this repo are not necessary the best and most efficient solutions, but each solution is what I knew at that point.
